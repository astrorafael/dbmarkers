# dbmarkers

Utility to incoporate tempo markers to various DAWs and musical apps.

Downbeat markers for a song are automatically generated by the [madmom project's DBNDownBeatTracker utility](https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom)

 The DBNDownBeatTracker program detects all beats and downbeats in an audio file according to the method described in:

    "Joint Beat and Downbeat Tracking with Recurrent Neural Networks"
    Sebastian BÃ¶ck, Florian Krebs and Gerhard Widmer.
    Proceedings of the 17th International Society for Music Information
    Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), 2016.

```bash   
 $ DBNDownBeatTracker single INFILE [-o OUTFILE]
```

The resulting OUTFILE is a tab separated file of durations in seconds and the beats sequence (1,2,3,4)

This utility takes this OUTFILE and incrporates this information into DAWs and musical apps.
